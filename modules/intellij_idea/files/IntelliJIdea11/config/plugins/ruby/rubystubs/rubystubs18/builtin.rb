#   >= 2 Ruby prohibits the loading of program files from globally writable locations.
#   >= 3 All newly created objects are considered tainted.
#   >= 4 Ruby effectively partitions the running program in two. Nontainted objects may
#        not be modified. Typically, this will be used to create a sandbox: the program sets
#        up an environment using a lower $SAFE level, then resets $SAFE to 4 to prevent
